                                <h1>Why ICT?</h1>
                                <p><strong>Since my childhood I was always interested in technologies.</strong> Not only because my <strong>mother and father both work in ICT business in large Tech/Bank companies</strong>, but also because I was just fascinated by how a computers work. What is going on in that magical tech box, that turns ones and zeros into the image. </p>
                                <p>Later in life I figured out that <strong>I want to work, just like my parents in the ICT business.</strong> So, from grade six I started going to the additional programming classes in programming school. I went there for 5 years and I learnt there a lot. How to program in HTML and Pascal (very old Programming language) little bit in OOP.</p>

                                <h1>Why HZ?</h1>
                                <p>I choose HZ because <strong>I liked the structure and description of the course</strong> more than any other university that I have seen. Also I figured out that in the Netherlands<strong>education quality is much better and the final diploma is recognized more</strong> than some of Latvian university’s diploma.</p>
                                <p>Also because HZ is quiet small university the education would be more personal and you could actually talk with lectures face to face more. Unlike university’s where there are more than 300 first year students and all classes art taught in very large auditoriums.</p>

                                <p>	The thing that motivates me the most<strong> is trying to go beyond 100%.</strong> Trying to prove others that you can do things that they could never imagine could be done.</p>
                                <p><strong> Basically that’s how I learnt to draw.</strong> I pushed myself to the limit and in the end surprised everyone that I learnt to draw at high level in short period of time.</p>
