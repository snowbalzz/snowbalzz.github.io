                                <p>What is motivation? What does it do us? According to the articles like <strong> Sparknotes.com. 2020 |Motivation: What Is Motivation?|</strong> and <strong>Stunningmotivation.com.2020 | What is motivation? |</strong>, motivation is internal process. </p>
                                <p>This internal process initiates, guides and moves a person towards a goal or a set idea. This term is usually used to describe why people are doing what they are doing.</p>
                                <p>What drives them to wake up in the morning and go beyond their bed. It is also a process that drives us change our behavior and to improve ourselves.</p>

                                <p>But what kind of motivations exist today? What are the types of them? <strong>Cherry, K., 2020 |The Psychology Of What Motivates Us|</strong> and <strong> Shawn, L., 2020 | What is motivation? |</strong> state that there are <strong>2 types of motivation</strong> that exist today. Intrinsic Motivation and Extrinsic motivation.</p>

                                <p>It is a motivation that’s comes <strong>purely from inside of you</strong>. A good example of is that you do things not to get a prize for it, but because <strong>you want to prove yourself</strong>.</p>
                                <p>An example from me is that without intrinsic motivation I would never be able to learn to draw as good as I am right now. Because I wanted to prove myself that I can draw better than some of my artist friends who share their art amongst themselves.</p>

                                <p>It is a motivation that arises from the outside of the individual and almost always includes reward. Money, fame, power, luxury or trophy.</p>
                                <p>For me the best example are parents who always told you to stay calm and quiet and, in the end, youwill get a new toy or a candy as a reward. Which for me was very good motivator as I am 
                                Usually very loud and annoying to some people.

                                <p>	The thing that motivates me the most<strong> is trying to go beyond 100%.</strong> Trying to prove others that you can do things that they could never imagine could be done. Basically that’s how I learnt to draw.</p>
                                <p>I pushed myself to the limit and in the end surprised everyone that I learnt to draw at high level in short period of time.</p>
